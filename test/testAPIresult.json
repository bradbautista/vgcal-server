The vision of the team is to create a MMO focused on challenging, group-based experiences in an expansive, evolving world full of exploration. Many tenets of the game harken back to early games of the genre, rather than attempting to please a mass-market audience by making progression extremely easy. Visionary Realms understands that this game is not for everyone, but believes there is a core audience of MMO players out there who desire a challenge that is truly rewarding.</p><h3>Tenets</h3><ul><li>Content is King.</li><li>In-game economies should be built upon delaying and minimizing item value deflation.</li><li>Gameplay that focuses on rich combat and group mechanics.</li><li>True challenge creates the most truly rewarding experience.</li><li>Social bonds between players are a result (in part) to designed downtime.</li><li>For players to feel immersed in a massive world, it must be populated with intelligent inhabitants.</li><li>The sense of accomplishment earned from a shared experience is always greater than one earned alone.</li></ul><h2>Lore</h2><h3>Terminus</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2590483-a96286f4691584d4722102adc68f839e_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2590483\" data-ratio=\"1.2942857142857\" data-width=\"700\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 700px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:129.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2590483-a96286f4691584d4722102adc68f839e_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2590483\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2590483-a96286f4691584d4722102adc68f839e_large.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2590483-a96286f4691584d4722102adc68f839e_large.jpg 700w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2590483-a96286f4691584d4722102adc68f839e_large.jpg 494w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px\" data-width=\"494\"></a></figure><p>Terminus is a world created by an amalgamation of mortal and planar shards that collided after what was left over from an all but dead universe many centuries ago. Many of the deities and demigods that ruled those ancient worlds have remained, which resulted in a tumultuous landscape of politics, religions, and cultures between the many races of Terminus.</p><h3>The Celestial Era</h3><p>A time when only one deity existed throughout the universe. Known simply as Nexus, her followers spread her influence throughout countless worlds and civilizations over the course of many millennia. It was a time of peace and prosperity. That is until the Myraxys arrived.</p><h3>The Dark Era</h3><p>A force of corruption, known as Myraxys, began to spread across the universe from the darkest reaches of space. Over the centuries, Myraxys took over entire worlds and, despite the power of Nexus, was on the verge of consuming even Terminus. As a last resort, Nexus unleashed what would become known as Terminus Arcana, which extinguished all life within the universe, thus eliminating the plague of Myraxys.</p><h3>The Lost Era</h3><p>Even Nexus was nearly eliminated by Terminus Arcana. After an unknown amount of time, she eventually regained her power. She was able to gather fragments of the shattered worlds and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/planes-of-existence/3015-4166/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4166\">planes</a> in an effort to create new life. These were the first planar collisions that began to make Terminus what it is today.</p><h3>The Cataclysmic Era</h3><p>Hundreds and thousands of fragments of distant worlds were colliding together to form the new surface of Terminus. In an attempt to save survivors, Nexus made herself known to them and used what powers she had left to help them thrive in this strange new world. But, with so many races from countless worlds now living side-by-side with limited resources, war was inevitable.</p><h3>The Martial Era</h3><p>Eventually, the collisions ceased. Soon after, war ran rampant throughout Terminus as civilizations and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/gods/3015-1047/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1047\">gods</a> themselves fought for survival. The various pantheons of <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/human/3015-810/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-810\">humans</a> successfully formed alliances among themselves and thrived. The <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/reptilian-humanoid/3015-3231/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3231\">reptilian</a> race of Vrilaksa sought refuge underground. The <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/dwarves/3015-940/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-940\">dwarves</a>' mighty fortresses allowed them to defend the lands they rode in on. The <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/ogres/3015-1426/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1426\">ogres</a> fought amongst themselves thanks to the greed and stubbornness of their various gods. The most notable war, known as Dragon March, was a result of the dragon-riding, god-king Oranthel leading his legion of <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/undead/3015-1155/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1155\">undead</a> in a nearly successful attempt to exterminate the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/elves/3015-537/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-537\">elven</a> civilizations.</p><h3>The Pantheon Era</h3><p>After an era ravaged by war, the Pantheon Era was one primarily consisting of the various pantheons establishing the borders forged by the previous wars and investing in the growth and prosperity of their people. Some of the deities regained enough power to create planar palaces and fortresses away from the terrestrial realm.</p><h3>The Risen Era</h3><p>After several hundred years had passed since the planar collisions, they began once again. Nexus returned to Terminus along with an army of legendary heroes who were thought lost for eternity after the first clashes of worlds. They became known as \"Fallen Heroes\" among the various pantheons already existing on and within Terminus. This is the current era of the Terminus timeline.</p><h2>Races</h2><h3>Archai</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2840251-archai.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2840251\" data-ratio=\"1.81\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:181.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2840251-archai.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2840251\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2840251-archai.png\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2840251-archai.png 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2840251-archai.png\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2840251-archai.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a></figure><ul><li><strong>Home World: </strong>Roa</li><li><strong>Terminus Home: </strong>Su'Roa</li><li><strong>Pantheon: </strong>Aoeyn</li><li><strong>Language: </strong></li></ul><p>Archai are a tall race of people who are descendants of a race known as Aoeyn from the crystalline planet of Roa. The Aoeyn were destroyed by the followers of an evil deity known simply as The Celestial Lord, then reconstructed as a slave race, which became the Archai. Though enslaved, the new race discovered the ability to bond themselves with their environment. At a young age, each Archai goes through a ceremony known as \"The True Birth\" where their bodies graft with one of the four primary <a href=\"/elements/3015-160/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-160\">elements</a> (earth, fire, wind, water) or even metals or minerals. This fusion is represented by markings on their bodies that remain for the rest of their lives. This power allowed them to wage a war that freed them from slavery.</p><p>On Terminus, the Archai founded Su'Roa (\"Little Home\") on a small island of diverse geology. Though they are viewed by many as stoic warriors, the Archai quite enjoy songs and look for any excuse for a celebration.</p><h3>Dwarves</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2840252-dwarf.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2840252\" data-ratio=\"1.81\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:181.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2840252-dwarf.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2840252\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2840252-dwarf.png\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2840252-dwarf.png 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2840252-dwarf.png\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2840252-dwarf.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a></figure><ul><li><strong>Home World: </strong>Strontia</li><li><strong>Terminus Home: </strong>Strontian Mountains</li><li><strong>Pantheon: </strong>The Holy Strata</li><li><strong>Language: </strong>Stront</li></ul><p><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/dwarves/3015-940/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-940\">Dwarves</a> are a race of people who are small in stature, yet produce some of the mightiest <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/warriors/3015-2646/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2646\">warriors</a> ever seen. Their underground culture is largely based upon <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/mining/3015-1753/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1753\">mining</a>, engineering, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/smithing/3015-3621/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3621\">smithing</a>, and other crafting. The dwarves' society is segregated into many separate sects and clans they contribute to the betterment of the race in different ways. Those who choose to leave the tunnels beneath the Strontian Mountains enter the world of Terminus equipped with some of the most finely crafted weapons and armor in the world, which makes them fearsome despite their size.</p><p>When the dwarves arrived on Terminus, they were still underground and the world was wracked with earthquakes. Their Pantheon, the Holy Strata, intervened and used the last of their divine power to stabilize the region the dwarves were in, which later became known as the Strontian Mountains. The dwarves' king, Udo Ironstorm, immediately commissioned temples that served as tombs for their fallen Pantheon with the hope that one day they would return. In the years that followed, the dwarves built a series of massive towers known as the North Watch to defend themselves from the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/ogres/3015-1426/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1426\">ogres</a> to the north. Later, the woodland <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/elves/3015-537/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-537\">elves</a> came to the dwarves after discovering a portion of Strontia that must have been separated from the dwarves upon colliding into Terminus. It was this lonely mountain from which <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/trolls/3015-1446/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1446\">trolls</a> had been introduced to the new world. The dwarves formed an alliance with the elves in order to drive the trolls out, eventually to the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/swamp/3035-2086/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2086\">swamps</a> in the south. Since then, the dwarves also formed an alliance with the humans of Celestia, which led to a thriving trade market.</p><h3>Elves</h3><ul><li><strong>Home World: </strong>Mythantya</li><li><strong>Terminus Home: </strong>The Falmyrys</li><li><strong>Pantheon: </strong>Ryn'Etryas</li><li><strong>Language: </strong>Etryan</li></ul><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2597628-9393268742-3de15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2597628\" data-ratio=\"1.1627906976744\" data-width=\"688\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 688px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:116.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2597628-9393268742-3de15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2597628\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" data-width=\"550\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2597628-9393268742-3de15.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2597628-9393268742-3de15.jpg 688w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2597628-9393268742-3de15.jpg 550w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2597628-9393268742-3de15.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2597628-9393268742-3de15.jpg 688w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2597628-9393268742-3de15.jpg 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" data-width=\"550\"></noscript></a></figure><p><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/elves/3015-537/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-537\">Elves</a> are a spiritual race of people that prefer to live among nature in the woodlands of Terminus. They are considered to be the oldest race in the universe, and as such they have evolved into the most graceful, elegant people. While being the most evolved race, many still choose to live simple lives in the wilderness as master craftsmen in woodworking, smithing, and more. There are others, though, who have opted to adventure beyond the forest as scouts, rangers, other professions.</p><p>Two types of elves have existed since before the planar collisions that brought them to Terminus; the Fal'Etryan (<a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/wood-elves/3015-3915/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3915\">Wood Elves</a>) and the Do'Etryan (<a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/dark-elves/3015-2088/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2088\">Dark Elves</a>). While the wood elves inhabit the treetops of the forest, the dark elves thrive in the \"root realm\" beneath the forest floor. After arriving on Terminus, their civil war continued until the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/dragons/3015-551/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-551\">dragons</a> of Kaul'Odun invaded from the south, seeing the opportunity to claim the lands of the warring elves. In the eleventh hour, when defeat was imminent, the elvish Pantheon known as Ryn'Etryas arrived and battled the dragon god into retreating. The result led to a treaty between the two factions of elves. Without constant war, their society thrived, yet they remained reclusive and wary of other races. Slowly, the elves formed trade alliances with several other civilizations.</p><h3>Gnome</h3><ul><li><strong>Home World: </strong>Aruska</li><li><strong>Terminus Home: </strong>Skyfen Mountains</li><li><strong>Pantheon: </strong>Trove Lords</li><li><strong>Language: </strong>Arcana</li></ul><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2602357-6573a7baa357357650d9559d871b672c_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2602357\" data-ratio=\"1.1627906976744\" data-width=\"688\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 688px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:116.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2602357-6573a7baa357357650d9559d871b672c_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2602357\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" data-width=\"550\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2602357-6573a7baa357357650d9559d871b672c_large.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2602357-6573a7baa357357650d9559d871b672c_large.jpg 688w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2602357-6573a7baa357357650d9559d871b672c_large.jpg 550w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2602357-6573a7baa357357650d9559d871b672c_large.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2602357-6573a7baa357357650d9559d871b672c_large.jpg 688w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2602357-6573a7baa357357650d9559d871b672c_large.jpg 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" data-width=\"550\"></noscript></a></figure><p><a href=\"/gnomes/3015-1447/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1447\">Gnomes</a> are a small race of people living underground that are wholly devoted to all things magical. Not only are they masters of casting all variations of magic, they believe it to be the foundation of life and the universe itself. There are many who believe the gnomes are slightly insane, but are still willing to deal with them due to the gnomes' uniquely crafted, magically imbued items and trinkets.</p><p>The gnomes' home world of Aruska was a realm without gods. After arriving on Terminus, the gnomes continued to live underground, unbeknownst to all the other races. Their devotion to magic led to the discovery of the Plane of Arcana and the creation of their own pantheon. It was dwarven miners who first discovered one of the gnomish cities. The dwarves referred to it as a treasure trove due to the magical and mechanical wonders they found there. The gnomes accepted this description and began referring to their new pantheon as the Trove Lords. Soon, their greed led them to the surface of Terminus in search of magical relics from all the other races. The gnomes were able to steal many of these items in secret due to abilities such as teleportation. This angered the Ethosians, a tribe of humans who are equally adept in the ways of magic. When the Ethosians discovered a trove beneath Celestius, a war erupted. This led to the gnomes abandoning all known troves and escaping to still unknown locations. Not even those gnomes who were left behind know where their brothers and sisters have gone, and now reside on the surface often as nomadic crafters, merchants, and casters for hire.</p><h3>Halfling</h3><ul><li><strong>Home World: </strong>Dohmchanta</li><li><strong>Terminus Home: </strong>The Blackwoods</li><li><strong>Pantheon: </strong>Ryn'Etryas</li><li><strong>Language: </strong>Dohma</li></ul><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2602346-f644a239c4e53b4a057a16a949a1c3d4_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2602346\" data-ratio=\"1.1627906976744\" data-width=\"688\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 688px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:116.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2602346-f644a239c4e53b4a057a16a949a1c3d4_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2602346\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" data-width=\"550\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2602346-f644a239c4e53b4a057a16a949a1c3d4_large.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2602346-f644a239c4e53b4a057a16a949a1c3d4_large.jpg 688w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2602346-f644a239c4e53b4a057a16a949a1c3d4_large.jpg 550w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2602346-f644a239c4e53b4a057a16a949a1c3d4_large.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2602346-f644a239c4e53b4a057a16a949a1c3d4_large.jpg 688w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2602346-f644a239c4e53b4a057a16a949a1c3d4_large.jpg 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" data-width=\"550\"></noscript></a></figure><p><a href=\"/halflings/3015-2643/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2643\">Halflings</a> are a humble, resourceful, short race of people who are typically content with never leaving the hills, fields, and woods they call home. Their farmers grow many unique crops, and their crafters draw traders and merchants from all other realms. Many other races see these characteristics of halflings and underestimate their abilities when it comes to combat. Over the years, halflings have become experts in dexterity and agility, which makes them masters of stealth.</p><p>The halflings came to Terminus upon a fragment of their peaceful, garden-like home world of Dohmchanta. There they lived mostly quiet lives and worshipped a deity known as Cailloc, the Mother of All, whom none had ever actually seen. After crashing into Terminus, their goddess revealed herself to them as a vengeful witch who was furious following the loss of her realm. Using the last of what would remain of her power as a god, she banished all the halflings from what was left of Dohmchanta, keeping it for herself. The surviving halflings were refugees scattered in a dangerous, unfamiliar world. They eventually settled in a wooded area of Celestius known as the Blackwoods where they were later discovered by the <a href=\"/wood-elves/3015-3915/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3915\">Wood Elves</a> of Falmyrys. The two races formed a strong bond thanks to their shared love of nature and crafting. Having lost their deity, the halflings soon adopted the Elvish pantheon of Ryn'Etryas. After some time, the divine circle that makes up the pantheon of Ryn'Etryas accepted a halfling hero into their ranks. Whether Cailloc still lives and where the remains of Dohmchanta are located continue to be a mystery to the halflings.</p><h3>Human</h3><ul><li><strong>Home World:</strong> Daera</li><li><strong>Terminus Home:</strong> Kingsreach, Plains of Triundia, Desert of A'Moka</li><li><strong>Pantheon: </strong>Trinariad</li><li><strong>Language: </strong>Triundan</li></ul><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2596189-6a3be9d5a06a6785fda2cb26d7d78663_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2596189\" data-ratio=\"1.1628571428571\" data-width=\"700\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 700px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:116.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2596189-6a3be9d5a06a6785fda2cb26d7d78663_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2596189\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" data-width=\"550\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2596189-6a3be9d5a06a6785fda2cb26d7d78663_large.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2596189-6a3be9d5a06a6785fda2cb26d7d78663_large.jpg 700w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2596189-6a3be9d5a06a6785fda2cb26d7d78663_large.jpg 550w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2596189-6a3be9d5a06a6785fda2cb26d7d78663_large.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2596189-6a3be9d5a06a6785fda2cb26d7d78663_large.jpg 700w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2596189-6a3be9d5a06a6785fda2cb26d7d78663_large.jpg 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" data-width=\"550\"></noscript></a></figure><p><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/human/3015-810/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-810\">Humans</a> on Terminus consist of four different tribes, and together they are one of the most populous races in the world. From the continent of Celestius, humans were the quickest to adapt to their new surroundings after arriving on Terminus. Their versatility has allowed them to thrive in various ways as well as settle many areas outside their own regions.</p><p>Briggaens are a feudal tribe of humans who landed on the western coast of Celestius. Right next door to them are Maratans, a militant empire that had been at war with the Briggaens on Daera for many years. Their war continued on Terminus with the direct help of their gods until the arrival of the Platocians, an erudite tribe of humans whose shard crashed into the ocean forcing the surviving refugees to seek shelter among the Briggaens. The Platocian god Ulenicus successfully formed a treaty between the tribes, thus becoming the Kingdom of Triundia. The Maratan god Oranthel rejected this treaty and continued to wreak havoc upon Briggaen lands, which led to his exile from the pantheon of gods. He now continues his mission with a smattering of followers as a mortal god-king.</p><p>The Ethosians, a mystical tribe of humans, reside far away from the others in the heart of the deserts of Celestius. Oranthel sought to join forces with them but was denied, and instead aligned himself with a powerful dragon god known as Kaul'Odun. Oranthel's Maratan soldiers were supplemented with undead revenants and drakes as they attacked the capital of Triundia. Even so, Oranthel was unsuccessful again. Since then, the Triundan empire has thrived and spread to new lands. Meanwhile, Ethosians have kept secluded in their desert lands.</p><h3>Ogre</h3><ul><li><strong>Origin World: </strong>Gruundark</li><li><strong>Terminus Home: </strong>Icehammer Steppes</li><li><strong>Pantheon: </strong>The Shattered Maul</li><li><strong>Language: </strong>Gruun</li></ul><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2596222-1518556458-c885c.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2596222\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"700\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 700px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2596222-1518556458-c885c.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2596222\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2596222-1518556458-c885c.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2596222-1518556458-c885c.jpg 700w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2596222-1518556458-c885c.jpg 640w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2596222-1518556458-c885c.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2596222-1518556458-c885c.jpg 700w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2596222-1518556458-c885c.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\"></noscript></a></figure><p><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/ogres/3015-1426/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1426\">Ogres</a> are a nomadic, anarchistic race of powerful behemoths. At about twice the size of a human, ogres easily instill fear and dread into almost any foe, which includes any type of creature including themselves. While they have no respect for any other race, clans of ogres are often at war with each other, which inhibits their ability to become a dominant population on Terminus. This is a result of the civil war within their own pantheon of gods, The Shattered Maul. Some ogres have become tired of the civil wars and migrated south seeking lives as mercenaries. Due to the shrinking population, the ogre gods descended from deity status and now rule warring clans as mortal god-kings. A deity once thought lost, Djrodn the Plunder God, has recently returned and promises to unite the ogres under one empire that will conquer Terminus.</p><h3>Revenant</h3><ul><li><strong>Origin World:</strong> Terminus</li><li><strong>Terminus Home:</strong> The Dead Ridges</li><li><strong>Pantheon:</strong> Myraxian</li><li><strong>Language:</strong> Chatter</li></ul><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2596204-9951426001-f6a37.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2596204\" data-ratio=\"1.1627906976744\" data-width=\"688\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 688px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:116.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2596204-9951426001-f6a37.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2596204\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" data-width=\"550\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2596204-9951426001-f6a37.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2596204-9951426001-f6a37.jpg 688w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2596204-9951426001-f6a37.jpg 550w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2596204-9951426001-f6a37.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2596204-9951426001-f6a37.jpg 688w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2596204-9951426001-f6a37.jpg 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" data-width=\"550\"></noscript></a></figure><p>After crashing into Terminus, some renounced their gods for forsaking them and lived the rest of their lives as atheists.

When the god-king Oranthel needed more soldiers, he enslaved legions of <a href=\"/undead/3015-1155/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1155\">undead</a> with the magic of Myraxys. With the aid of deathly powerful Myraxian magic, the undead became more than just a minor nuisance. Being undead, they fought as warriors without fear while instilling fear in many of their foes. With the god-king defeated by the Triundan Empire in the Dragon March, the revenants were free to wander Terminus again. While most revenants continue to be evil horrors that terrorize the living, there are a small percentage that have been born again in their undeath. Together, they seek to lay the foundation of an undead city near the volcanoes in the far east.</p><h3>T'Jinn</h3><ul><li><strong>Home World: </strong>Terminus</li><li><strong>Terminus Home: </strong>None</li><li><strong>Pantheon: </strong>Nexus</li><li><strong>Language: </strong>Arcana</li></ul><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2602367-4e31fd256dbab955a3bda2c1b1dc749c_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2602367\" data-ratio=\"1.1627906976744\" data-width=\"688\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 688px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:116.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2602367-4e31fd256dbab955a3bda2c1b1dc749c_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2602367\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" data-width=\"550\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2602367-4e31fd256dbab955a3bda2c1b1dc749c_large.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2602367-4e31fd256dbab955a3bda2c1b1dc749c_large.jpg 688w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2602367-4e31fd256dbab955a3bda2c1b1dc749c_large.jpg 550w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2602367-4e31fd256dbab955a3bda2c1b1dc749c_large.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2602367-4e31fd256dbab955a3bda2c1b1dc749c_large.jpg 688w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2602367-4e31fd256dbab955a3bda2c1b1dc749c_large.jpg 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" data-width=\"550\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Also known as The Bound, the T'Jinn are an inorganic race of sentient magic. Some believe they are the result of the powerful magic that brought these worlds together combining the spirits of the people who originally called Terminus home. Over the centuries, left untouched near the core of Terminus, the combination of magic and these spirits created crystals known as Sparks, which each contained a T'Jinn. It is not clear who discovered the Sparks first, but both the gnomes and Ethosians used their knowledge of the arcane to enslave the T'Jinn. They spent many years in service of these other races until Nexus intervened and freed her ancient followers.

She is the omnipotent heart of the universe and ruled as such for an unfathomable length of time. That was until the dark gods of Myraxys entered the fray from the void, which led to the War Before Ages. As a last resort, she unleashed what has become known as Terminus Arcana, which shattered nearly all of existence.
