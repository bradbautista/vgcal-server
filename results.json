Many of the deities and demigods that ruled those ancient worlds have remained, which resulted in a tumultuous landscape of politics, religions, and cultures between the many races of Terminus.</p><h3>The Celestial Era</h3><p>A time when only one deity existed throughout the universe. Known simply as Nexus, her followers spread her influence throughout countless worlds and civilizations over the course of many millennia. It was a time of peace and prosperity. That is until the Myraxys arrived.</p><h3>The Dark Era</h3><p>A force of corruption, known as Myraxys, began to spread across the universe from the darkest reaches of space. Over the centuries, Myraxys took over entire worlds and, despite the power of Nexus, was on the verge of consuming even Terminus. As a last resort, Nexus unleashed what would become known as Terminus Arcana, which extinguished all life within the universe, thus eliminating the plague of Myraxys.</p><h3>The Lost Era</h3><p>Even Nexus was nearly eliminated by Terminus Arcana. After an unknown amount of time, she eventually regained her power. She was able to gather fragments of the shattered worlds and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/planes-of-existence/3015-4166/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4166\">planes</a> in an effort to create new life. These were the first planar collisions that began to make Terminus what it is today.</p><h3>The Cataclysmic Era</h3><p>Hundreds and thousands of fragments of distant worlds were colliding together to form the new surface of Terminus. In an attempt to save survivors, Nexus made herself known to them and used what powers she had left to help them thrive in this strange new world. But, with so many races from countless worlds now living side-by-side with limited resources, war was inevitable.</p><h3>The Martial Era</h3><p>Eventually, the collisions ceased. Soon after, war ran rampant throughout Terminus as civilizations and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/gods/3015-1047/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1047\">gods</a> themselves fought for survival. The various pantheons of <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/human/3015-810/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-810\">humans</a> successfully formed alliances among themselves and thrived. The <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/reptilian-humanoid/3015-3231/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3231\">reptilian</a> race of Vrilaksa sought refuge underground. The <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/dwarves/3015-940/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-940\">dwarves</a>' mighty fortresses allowed them to defend the lands they rode in on. The <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/ogres/3015-1426/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1426\">ogres</a> fought amongst themselves thanks to the greed and stubbornness of their various gods. The most notable war, known as Dragon March, was a result of the dragon-riding, god-king Oranthel leading his legion of <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/undead/3015-1155/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1155\">undead</a> in a nearly successful attempt to exterminate the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/elves/3015-537/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-537\">elven</a> civilizations.</p><h3>The Pantheon Era</h3><p>After an era ravaged by war, the Pantheon Era was one primarily consisting of the various pantheons establishing the borders forged by the previous wars and investing in the growth and prosperity of their people. Some of the deities regained enough power to create planar palaces and fortresses away from the terrestrial realm.</p><h3>The Risen Era</h3><p>After several hundred years had passed since the planar collisions, they began once again. Nexus returned to Terminus along with an army of legendary heroes who were thought lost for eternity after the first clashes of worlds. They became known as \"Fallen Heroes\" among the various pantheons already existing on and within Terminus. This is the current era of the Terminus timeline.</p><h2>Races</h2><h3>Archai</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2840251-archai.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2840251\" data-ratio=\"1.81\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:181.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2840251-archai.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2840251\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2840251-archai.png\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2840251-archai.png 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2840251-archai.png\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2840251-archai.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a></figure><ul><li><strong>Home World: </strong>Roa</li><li><strong>Terminus Home: </strong>Su'Roa</li><li><strong>Pantheon: </strong>Aoeyn</li><li><strong>Language: </strong></li></ul><p>Archai are a tall race of people who are descendants of a race known as Aoeyn from the crystalline planet of Roa. The Aoeyn were destroyed by the followers of an evil deity known simply as The Celestial Lord, then reconstructed as a slave race, which became the Archai. Though enslaved, the new race discovered the ability to bond themselves with their environment. At a young age, each Archai goes through a ceremony known as \"The True Birth\" where their bodies graft with one of the four primary <a href=\"/elements/3015-160/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-160\">elements</a> (earth, fire, wind, water) or even metals or minerals. This fusion is represented by markings on their bodies that remain for the rest of their lives. This power allowed them to wage a war that freed them from slavery.</p><p>On Terminus, the Archai founded Su'Roa (\"Little Home\") on a small island of diverse geology. Though they are viewed by many as stoic warriors, the Archai quite enjoy songs and look for any excuse for a celebration.</p><h3>Dwarves</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2840252-dwarf.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2840252\" data-ratio=\"1.81\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:181.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2840252-dwarf.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2840252\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2840252-dwarf.png\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2840252-dwarf.png 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2840252-dwarf.png\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2840252-dwarf.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a></figure><ul><li><strong>Home World: </strong>Strontia</li><li><strong>Terminus Home: </strong>Strontian Mountains</li><li><strong>Pantheon: </strong>The Holy Strata</li><li><strong>Language: </strong>Stront</li></ul><p><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/dwarves/3015-940/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-940\">Dwarves</a> are a race of people who are small in stature, yet produce some of the mightiest <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/warriors/3015-2646/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2646\">warriors</a> ever seen. Their underground culture is largely based upon <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/mining/3015-1753/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1753\">mining</a>, engineering, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/smithing/3015-3621/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3621\">smithing</a>, and other crafting. The dwarves' society is segregated into many separate sects and clans they contribute to the betterment of the race in different ways. Those who choose to leave the tunnels beneath the Strontian Mountains enter the world of Terminus equipped with some of the most finely crafted weapons and armor in the world, which makes them fearsome despite their size.</p><p>When the dwarves arrived on Terminus, they were still underground and the world was wracked with earthquakes. Their Pantheon, the Holy Strata, intervened and used the last of their divine power to stabilize the region the dwarves were in, which later became known as the Strontian Mountains. The dwarves' king, Udo Ironstorm, immediately commissioned temples that served as tombs for their fallen Pantheon with the hope that one day they would return. In the years that followed, the dwarves built a series of massive towers known as the North Watch to defend themselves from the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/ogres/3015-1426/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1426\">ogres</a> to the north. Later, the woodland <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/elves/3015-537/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-537\">elves</a> came to the dwarves after discovering a portion of Strontia that must have been separated from the dwarves upon colliding into Terminus. It was this lonely mountain from which <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/trolls/3015-1446/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1446\">trolls</a> had been introduced to the new world. The dwarves formed an alliance with the elves in order to drive the trolls out, eventually to the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/swamp/3035-2086/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2086\">swamps</a> in the south. Since then, the dwarves also formed an alliance with the humans of Celestia, which led to a thriving trade market.</p><h3>Elves</h3><ul><li><strong>Home World: </strong>Mythantya</li><li><strong>Terminus Home: </strong>The Falmyrys</li><li><strong>Pantheon: </strong>Ryn'Etryas</li><li><strong>Language: </strong>Etryan</li></ul><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2597628-9393268742-3de15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2597628\" data-ratio=\"1.1627906976744\" data-width=\"688\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 688px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:116.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2597628-9393268742-3de15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2597628\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" data-width=\"550\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2597628-9393268742-3de15.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2597628-9393268742-3de15.jpg 688w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2597628-9393268742-3de15.jpg 550w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2597628-9393268742-3de15.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2597628-9393268742-3de15.jpg 688w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2597628-9393268742-3de15.jpg 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" data-width=\"550\"></noscript></a></figure><p><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/elves/3015-537/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-537\">Elves</a> are a spiritual race of people that prefer to live among nature in the woodlands of Terminus. They are considered to be the oldest race in the universe, and as such they have evolved into the most graceful, elegant people. While being the most evolved race, many still choose to live simple lives in the wilderness as master craftsmen in woodworking, smithing, and more. There are others, though, who have opted to adventure beyond the forest as scouts, rangers, other professions.</p><p>Two types of elves have existed since before the planar collisions that brought them to Terminus; the Fal'Etryan (<a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/wood-elves/3015-3915/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3915\">Wood Elves</a>) and the Do'Etryan (<a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/dark-elves/3015-2088/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2088\">Dark Elves</a>). While the wood elves inhabit the treetops of the forest, the dark elves thrive in the \"root realm\" beneath the forest floor. After arriving on Terminus, their civil war continued until the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/dragons/3015-551/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-551\">dragons</a> of Kaul'Odun invaded from the south, seeing the opportunity to claim the lands of the warring elves. In the eleventh hour, when defeat was imminent, the elvish Pantheon known as Ryn'Etryas arrived and battled the dragon god into retreating. The result led to a treaty between the two factions of elves. Without constant war, their society thrived, yet they remained reclusive and wary of other races. Slowly, the elves formed trade alliances with several other civilizations.</p><h3>Gnome</h3><ul><li><strong>Home World: </strong>Aruska</li><li><strong>Terminus Home: </strong>Skyfen Mountains</li><li><strong>Pantheon: </strong>Trove Lords</li><li><strong>Language: </strong>Arcana</li></ul><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2602357-6573a7baa357357650d9559d871b672c_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2602357\" data-ratio=\"1.1627906976744\" data-width=\"688\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 688px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:116.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2602357-6573a7baa357357650d9559d871b672c_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2602357\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" data-width=\"550\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2602357-6573a7baa357357650d9559d871b672c_large.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2602357-6573a7baa357357650d9559d871b672c_large.jpg 688w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2602357-6573a7baa357357650d9559d871b672c_large.jpg 550w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2602357-6573a7baa357357650d9559d871b672c_large.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2602357-6573a7baa357357650d9559d871b672c_large.jpg 688w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2602357-6573a7baa357357650d9559d871b672c_large.jpg 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" data-width=\"550\"></noscript></a></figure><p><a href=\"/gnomes/3015-1447/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1447\">Gnomes</a> are a small race of people living underground that are wholly devoted to all things magical.

After arriving on Terminus, the gnomes continued to live underground, unbeknownst to all the other races. Their devotion to magic led to the discovery of the Plane of Arcana and the creation of their own pantheon. It was dwarven miners who first discovered one of the gnomish cities. The dwarves referred to it as a treasure trove due to the magical and mechanical wonders they found there. The gnomes accepted this description and began referring to their new pantheon as the Trove Lords. Soon, their greed led them to the surface of Terminus in search of magical relics from all the other races. The gnomes were able to steal many of these items in secret due to abilities such as teleportation. This angered the Ethosians, a tribe of humans who are equally adept in the ways of magic. When the Ethosians discovered a trove beneath Celestius, a war erupted. This led to the gnomes abandoning all known troves and escaping to still unknown locations. Not even those gnomes who were left behind know where their brothers and sisters have gone, and now reside on the surface often as nomadic crafters, merchants, and casters for hire.</p><h3>Halfling</h3><ul><li><strong>Home World: </strong>Dohmchanta</li><li><strong>Terminus Home: </strong>The Blackwoods</li><li><strong>Pantheon: </strong>Ryn'Etryas</li><li><strong>Language: </strong>Dohma</li></ul><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2602346-f644a239c4e53b4a057a16a949a1c3d4_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2602346\" data-ratio=\"1.1627906976744\" data-width=\"688\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 688px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:116.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2602346-f644a239c4e53b4a057a16a949a1c3d4_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2602346\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" data-width=\"550\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2602346-f644a239c4e53b4a057a16a949a1c3d4_large.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2602346-f644a239c4e53b4a057a16a949a1c3d4_large.jpg 688w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2602346-f644a239c4e53b4a057a16a949a1c3d4_large.jpg 550w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2602346-f644a239c4e53b4a057a16a949a1c3d4_large.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2602346-f644a239c4e53b4a057a16a949a1c3d4_large.jpg 688w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2602346-f644a239c4e53b4a057a16a949a1c3d4_large.jpg 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" data-width=\"550\"></noscript></a></figure><p><a href=\"/halflings/3015-2643/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2643\">Halflings</a> are a humble, resourceful, short race of people who are typically content with never leaving the hills, fields, and woods they call home. Their farmers grow many unique crops, and their crafters draw traders and merchants from all other realms. Many other races see these characteristics of halflings and underestimate their abilities when it comes to combat. Over the years, halflings have become experts in dexterity and agility, which makes them masters of stealth.</p><p>The halflings came to Terminus upon a fragment of their peaceful, garden-like home world of Dohmchanta. There they lived mostly quiet lives and worshipped a deity known as Cailloc, the Mother of All, whom none had ever actually seen. After crashing into Terminus, their goddess revealed herself to them as a vengeful witch who was furious following the loss of her realm. Using the last of what would remain of her power as a god, she banished all the halflings from what was left of Dohmchanta, keeping it for herself. The surviving halflings were refugees scattered in a dangerous, unfamiliar world. They eventually settled in a wooded area of Celestius known as the Blackwoods where they were later discovered by the <a href=\"/wood-elves/3015-3915/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3915\">Wood Elves</a> of Falmyrys. The two races formed a strong bond thanks to their shared love of nature and crafting. Having lost their deity, the halflings soon adopted the Elvish pantheon of Ryn'Etryas. After some time, the divine circle that makes up the pantheon of Ryn'Etryas accepted a halfling hero into their ranks. Whether Cailloc still lives and where the remains of Dohmchanta are located continue to be a mystery to the halflings.</p><h3>Human</h3><ul><li><strong>Home World:</strong> Daera</li><li><strong>Terminus Home:</strong> Kingsreach, Plains of Triundia, Desert of A'Moka</li><li><strong>Pantheon: </strong>Trinariad</li><li><strong>Language: </strong>Triundan</li></ul><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2596189-6a3be9d5a06a6785fda2cb26d7d78663_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2596189\" data-ratio=\"1.1628571428571\" data-width=\"700\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 700px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:116.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2596189-6a3be9d5a06a6785fda2cb26d7d78663_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2596189\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" data-width=\"550\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2596189-6a3be9d5a06a6785fda2cb26d7d78663_large.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2596189-6a3be9d5a06a6785fda2cb26d7d78663_large.jpg 700w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2596189-6a3be9d5a06a6785fda2cb26d7d78663_large.jpg 550w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2596189-6a3be9d5a06a6785fda2cb26d7d78663_large.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2596189-6a3be9d5a06a6785fda2cb26d7d78663_large.jpg 700w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2596189-6a3be9d5a06a6785fda2cb26d7d78663_large.jpg 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" data-width=\"550\"></noscript></a></figure><p><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/human/3015-810/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-810\">Humans</a> on Terminus consist of four different tribes, and together they are one of the most populous races in the world. From the continent of Celestius, humans were the quickest to adapt to their new surroundings after arriving on Terminus. Their versatility has allowed them to thrive in various ways as well as settle many areas outside their own regions.</p><p>Briggaens are a feudal tribe of humans who landed on the western coast of Celestius. Right next door to them are Maratans, a militant empire that had been at war with the Briggaens on Daera for many years. Their war continued on Terminus with the direct help of their gods until the arrival of the Platocians, an erudite tribe of humans whose shard crashed into the ocean forcing the surviving refugees to seek shelter among the Briggaens. The Platocian god Ulenicus successfully formed a treaty between the tribes, thus becoming the Kingdom of Triundia. The Maratan god Oranthel rejected this treaty and continued to wreak havoc upon Briggaen lands, which led to his exile from the pantheon of gods. He now continues his mission with a smattering of followers as a mortal god-king.</p><p>The Ethosians, a mystical tribe of humans, reside far away from the others in the heart of the deserts of Celestius. Oranthel sought to join forces with them but was denied, and instead aligned himself with a powerful dragon god known as Kaul'Odun. Oranthel's Maratan soldiers were supplemented with undead revenants and drakes as they attacked the capital of Triundia. Even so, Oranthel was unsuccessful again. Since then, the Triundan empire has thrived and spread to new lands. Meanwhile, Ethosians have kept secluded in their desert lands.</p><h3>Ogre</h3><ul><li><strong>Origin World: </strong>Gruundark</li><li><strong>Terminus Home: </strong>Icehammer Steppes</li><li><strong>Pantheon: </strong>The Shattered Maul</li><li><strong>Language: </strong>Gruun</li></ul><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2596222-1518556458-c885c.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2596222\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"700\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 700px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2596222-1518556458-c885c.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2596222\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2596222-1518556458-c885c.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2596222-1518556458-c885c.jpg 700w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2596222-1518556458-c885c.jpg 640w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2596222-1518556458-c885c.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2596222-1518556458-c885c.jpg 700w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2596222-1518556458-c885c.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\"></noscript></a></figure><p><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/ogres/3015-1426/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1426\">Ogres</a> are a nomadic, anarchistic race of powerful behemoths. At about twice the size of a human, ogres easily instill fear and dread into almost any foe, which includes any type of creature including themselves. While they have no respect for any other race, clans of ogres are often at war with each other, which inhibits their ability to become a dominant population on Terminus. This is a result of the civil war within their own pantheon of gods, The Shattered Maul. Some ogres have become tired of the civil wars and migrated south seeking lives as mercenaries. Due to the shrinking population, the ogre gods descended from deity status and now rule warring clans as mortal god-kings. A deity once thought lost, Djrodn the Plunder God, has recently returned and promises to unite the ogres under one empire that will conquer Terminus.</p><h3>Revenant</h3><ul><li><strong>Origin World:</strong> Terminus</li><li><strong>Terminus Home:</strong> The Dead Ridges</li><li><strong>Pantheon:</strong> Myraxian</li><li><strong>Language:</strong> Chatter</li></ul><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2596204-9951426001-f6a37.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2596204\" data-ratio=\"1.1627906976744\" data-width=\"688\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 688px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:116.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2596204-9951426001-f6a37.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2596204\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" data-width=\"550\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2596204-9951426001-f6a37.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2596204-9951426001-f6a37.jpg 688w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2596204-9951426001-f6a37.jpg 550w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2596204-9951426001-f6a37.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2596204-9951426001-f6a37.jpg 688w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2596204-9951426001-f6a37.jpg 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" data-width=\"550\"></noscript></a></figure><p>After crashing into Terminus, some renounced their gods for forsaking them and lived the rest of their lives as atheists.

With the aid of deathly powerful Myraxian magic, the undead became more than just a minor nuisance. Being undead, they fought as warriors without fear while instilling fear in many of their foes. With the god-king defeated by the Triundan Empire in the Dragon March, the revenants were free to wander Terminus again. While most revenants continue to be evil horrors that terrorize the living, there are a small percentage that have been born again in their undeath. Together, they seek to lay the foundation of an undead city near the volcanoes in the far east.</p><h3>T'Jinn</h3><ul><li><strong>Home World: </strong>Terminus</li><li><strong>Terminus Home: </strong>None</li><li><strong>Pantheon: </strong>Nexus</li><li><strong>Language: </strong>Arcana</li></ul><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2602367-4e31fd256dbab955a3bda2c1b1dc749c_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2602367\" data-ratio=\"1.1627906976744\" data-width=\"688\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 688px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:116.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2602367-4e31fd256dbab955a3bda2c1b1dc749c_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2602367\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" data-width=\"550\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2602367-4e31fd256dbab955a3bda2c1b1dc749c_large.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2602367-4e31fd256dbab955a3bda2c1b1dc749c_large.jpg 688w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2602367-4e31fd256dbab955a3bda2c1b1dc749c_large.jpg 550w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2602367-4e31fd256dbab955a3bda2c1b1dc749c_large.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2602367-4e31fd256dbab955a3bda2c1b1dc749c_large.jpg 688w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2602367-4e31fd256dbab955a3bda2c1b1dc749c_large.jpg 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" data-width=\"550\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Also known as The Bound, the T'Jinn are an inorganic race of sentient magic. Some believe they are the result of the powerful magic that brought these worlds together combining the spirits of the people who originally called Terminus home. Over the centuries, left untouched near the core of Terminus, the combination of magic and these spirits created crystals known as Sparks, which each contained a T'Jinn. It is not clear who discovered the Sparks first, but both the gnomes and Ethosians used their knowledge of the arcane to enslave the T'Jinn. They spent many years in service of these other races until Nexus intervened and freed her ancient followers.

More specifically, she was once the only inhabitant of Terminus but single-handedly saved the souls of both mortals and gods alike after the first planar collisions. She is the omnipotent heart of the universe and ruled as such for an unfathomable length of time. That was until the dark gods of Myraxys entered the fray from the void, which led to the War Before Ages. As a last resort, she unleashed what has become known as Terminus Arcana, which shattered nearly all of existence.

the famous Final Fantasy VII title originally released on the Sony Playstation in 1997. FF7 Remake has been rebuilt from the ground up to be a JRPG with real-time action, fully-voiced characters, and modern graphics. Square Enix plans to release the Remake in episodic installments, with the first to be released April 10, 2020 (exclusively on PS4) and cover the Midgar portion of the game. A demo was released on PSN on March 3, 2020.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>Cloud Strife, a former first-class SOLDIER turned mercenary, is hired by the group Avalanche to help them destroy a Mako Reactor slowly poisoning the city. Though the group succeeds in their task, this act sets off a chain of events involving Avalanche, the evil Shinra Corporation, and a mysterious flower girl, with consequences for the whole world.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Players can switch between up to three party members in real-time, taking advantage of their attacks and abilities to defeat enemies in front of them. Though the player can only control one at a time, they can command any of them to use their unique abilities, magic spells, or items in their inventory.</p>","expected_release_day":10,"expected_release_month":4,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":2020,"guid":"3030-49974","id":49974,"image":{"icon_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/square_avatar/0/1992/3171743-screen%20shot%202020-03-03%20at%208.12.13%20am.png","medium_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1992/3171743-screen%20shot%202020-03-03%20at%208.12.13%20am.png","screen_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/screen_medium/0/1992/3171743-screen%20shot%202020-03-03%20at%208.12.13%20am.png","screen_large_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/1992/3171743-screen%20shot%202020-03-03%20at%208.12.13%20am.png","small_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/3171743-screen%20shot%202020-03-03%20at%208.12.13%20am.png","super_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/0/1992/3171743-screen%20shot%202020-03-03%20at%208.12.13%20am.png","thumb_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1992/3171743-screen%20shot%202020-03-03%20at%208.12.13%20am.png","tiny_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/square_mini/0/1992/3171743-screen%20shot%202020-03-03%20at%208.12.13%20am.png","original_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1992/3171743-screen%20shot%202020-03-03%20at%208.12.13%20am.png","image_tags":"All Images"},"image_tags":[{"api_detail_url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-49974/?filter=image_tag%3AAll+Images","name":"All Images","total":17},{"api_detail_url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-49974/?filter=image_tag%3APAX+West+2019","name":"PAX West 2019","total":9}],"name":"Final Fantasy VII Remake","number_of_user_reviews":0,"original_game_rating":[{"api_detail_url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-1/","id":1,"name":"ESRB: T"}],"original_release_date":null,"platforms":[{"api_detail_url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/","id":146,"name":"PlayStation 4","site_detail_url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/","abbreviation":"PS4"}],"site_detail_url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake/3030-49974/"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-50431/","date_added":"2015-07-24 23:50:29","date_last_updated":"2020-02-25 19:15:44","deck":"Blackwake is a multiplayer naval FPS focused on teamwork and cooperation.

Driftin, Vertix, Karnage and Krunker.","description":"<p>Foes.io is a 2D top-down battle royale game, released in 2017 by Yendis Entertainment</p><p>Each match has a maximum of 60 players and takes place in a forested setting, where the main landmarks are an abandoned small town at the road intersection, and a nearby military base. There's a 20-second \"grace period\" at the start of each match, where players cannot yet melee each other or discharge their guns, and so are allowed to loot in relative peace. Afterwards, it's open season for everyone, as the red zone rapidly begins to shrink.</p><p>There's a decent arsenal of melee and ranged weapons, and even the weaker ones can still kill players really quickly, so dodging and avoiding getting hit is a must. The obvious power of ranged weapons is balanced by their limited ammo, with LMG being particularly likely to run out in the middle of the firefight for careless players. Each player can also carry a maximum of two weapons if they haven't found a backpack, and three weapons if they did. However, they are likely to reserve one of these slots for a healing syringe, as there's no other way to recover health in the game.</p><p>Foes.io is also the first browser-based battle royale that features driveable vehicles. Cars and motorbikes can traverse the entire map in seconds, and are easily capable of running the other players over. However, drivers may also end up accidentally getting into the toxic red fog, or find themselves forced to execute a tight turn that leaves them a predictable target for the other players.</p>","expected_release_day":null,"expected_release_month":null,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":null,"guid":"3030-62310","id":62310,"image":{"icon_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/square_avatar/15/154673/3163683-screen%20shot%202020-02-03%20at%208.02.28%20am.png","medium_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/15/154673/3163683-screen%20shot%202020-02-03%20at%208.02.28%20am.png","screen_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/screen_medium/15/154673/3163683-screen%20shot%202020-02-03%20at%208.02.28%20am.png","screen_large_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/screen_kubrick/15/154673/3163683-screen%20shot%202020-02-03%20at%208.02.28%20am.png","small_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/15/154673/3163683-screen%20shot%202020-02-03%20at%208.02.28%20am.png","super_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/15/154673/3163683-screen%20shot%202020-02-03%20at%208.02.28%20am.png","thumb_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_avatar/15/154673/3163683-screen%20shot%202020-02-03%20at%208.02.28%20am.png","tiny_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/square_mini/15/154673/3163683-screen%20shot%202020-02-03%20at%208.02.28%20am.png","original_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/15/154673/3163683-screen%20shot%202020-02-03%20at%208.02.28%20am.png","image_tags":"All

Japan on February 6, 2020. It was later released by <a href=\"/xseed-games/3010-3540/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3540\">XSEED</a> in North America on March 3, 2020, will be released by <a href=\"/marvelous/3010-1777/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1777\">Marvelous</a> in Europe on March 27, 2020, and will be digitally released worldwide for the <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> on March 13, 2020.</p><p>A <a href=\"/spin-off/3015-1100/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1100\">spin-off</a> of the mobile RPG <a href=\"/granblue-fantasy/3030-49717/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-49717\">Granblue Fantasy</a>, Versus brings the game's characters and setting into a traditional fighting game reminiscent of the studio's <a href=\"/guilty-gear/3025-287/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-287\">Guilty Gear</a> and <a href=\"/blazblue/3025-1502/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1502\">BlazBlue</a> series. Similar to <a href=\"/guilty-gear-xrd-sign/3030-42679/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42679\">Guilty Gear Xrd -SIGN-</a> and <a href=\"/dragon-ball-fighterz/3030-59862/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-59862\">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a>, Versus uses the technique of specialized <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/cel-shading/3015-173/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-173\">cel-shading</a> and limited animation in <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/unreal-engine-4/3015-2551/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2551\">Unreal Engine 4</a> to give the illusion of 2D hand-drawn character art.</p><p>The game is also known for its <a href=\"/cooldowns/3015-2589/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2589\">cooldown</a>-based \"Skill\" system, where each character's <a href=\"/special-attacks/3015-327/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-327\">special</a> and <a href=\"/super-combo/3015-6149/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6149\">super moves</a> can be simplified with a dedicated shortcut button (the \"Skill\" button), and for its \"RPG Mode\": a side-scrolling beat-'em-up action-RPG mode that serves as the game's main campaign.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Each player has access to three basic Attack buttons (Light, Medium, and Heavy) and a bonus \"Unique Action\" button (which perform different actions based on the character chosen). Pressing both Light Attack and Unique Action performs a throw attempt, while pressing both Medium Attack and Heavy Attack performs an Overhead Attack. In addition, players can use an optional dedicated Block button, which can be used in conjunction with the joystick for quick evasions.</p><p>One of the key features of the game is its <a href=\"/cooldowns/3015-2589/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2589\">cooldown</a>-based \"Skill\" system, where each character's <a href=\"/special-attacks/3015-327/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-327\">special moves</a> can be performed simply by holding down one shortcut button (the Skill button) and tapping the joystick a specific direction. Traditional command inputs can be used instead, sacrificing simplicity for a shortened cooldown.</p><h3>Skybound Art</h3><p>Both players have an SBA Gauge, or \"Skybound Art Gauge\", which fills by dealing and receiving damage and serves as the game's <a href=\"/super-meter/3015-1013/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1013\">super meter</a>. When the gauge is completely full, players can perform a high-damaging <a href=\"/super-combo/3015-6149/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6149\">super move</a> known as a \"Skybound Art\".</p><p>If the character's vitality is 30% or lower, their HP gauge changes color and they can perform a one-time \"Super Skybound Art\".</p><h2>RPG Mode</h2><p>In addition to the standard fighting game mode, Versus features a unique campaign mode (RPG Mode) that allows up to two players to fight against waves of enemies in beat-em-up style action. Similar to the original Granblue Fantasy game, the player travels to various islands, clearing out enemies, and fighting boss characters to advance the story. Depending on their performance, the player can acquire new weapons or items to upgrade existing ones.</p><p>Players in this mode start off playing as Gran, but can unlock new characters to control as the story goes on.</p><h3>Plot</h3><p>Gran and a few of his crewmates head to Albion to meet up with Katalina, but are surprised to find an attack by soldiers of the Erste Empire, a nation that they defeated in the past, and that Katalina appears to have completely forgotten her history with Lyria and rejoined the Empire. As the Grandcypher travels around the Skydom, they encounter similar problems with former crewmembers forgetting their pasts and attacking Gran on sight.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p>The base game includes 11 playable characters and 1 unplayable boss (who was later made unlockable for play). Additional characters were made available as <a href=\"/downloadable-content/3015-329/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-329\">downloadable content</a>.</p><ul><li><a href=\"/gran/3005-39799/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-39799\"><strong>Gran</strong></a> - Granblue Fantasy's default male protagonist, Captain of the Grandcypher and newly-minted skyfarer.

Much like the first game, through no fault of your own the Vampire Society finds out about the embrace and puts you on trial with the intention of executing you. A Mass Embrace is considered an affront to the Camarilla, and any vampire with any shred of humanity. But it also risks their discovery by the mortals.</p><p>Before judgement can be laid out, the courthouse is engulfed in flames, and the player makes their escape. You'll have to find ways to feed your hunger for blood while uncovering a

Once the battle starts, aircraft fly around the screen, shooting down their opponents. All aircraft are on the same screen - if they fly off one side, they reappear on the other side of the screen. Different aircraft have different performance. Between rounds, players can upgrade their aircraft, and choose which Special Weapon to use. Special Weapons have different effects such as flamethrower or freeze rays, or floating bombs. Speed is controlled by diving to pick up speed. Climbing causes aircraft to lose speed. Aircraft can also roll to avoid damage.<br /><br />Players can have team games, or all on all.

href=\"/persona-5/3030-30486/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-30486\">Persona 5</a>, Scramble is set about half a year after the events of the True Ending of the game. The Phantom Thieves meet up again during summer vacation, hoping to enjoy themselves. However, mysterious mental shutdowns start happening all over Japan again, and the police think the Phantom Thieves are responsible, forcing the group to jump back into action to solve the mystery.</p><h2>New Characters</h2><h3>Sophia (ソフィア)</h3><p><em>VA: Misaki Kuno (JP)</em></p><ul><li>Codename: Sophie</li><li>Weapons: Yo-yos</li><li>Persona: Pithos</li></ul><p>An AI construct from the Metaverse who the Protagonist accidentally unlocks. She claims to be humanity's friend and fights together with the Phantom Thieves. In the Metaverse she manifests as a young girl with red hair braided in the shape of hearts and wears an oversized sweater. In the real world she appears as a smartphone app on the phones of the Phantom Thieves.</p><h3>Zenkichi Hasegawa</h3><p>A Public Security officer trying to find the ones responsible for the new wave of mental shutdowns.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Unlike the mainline Persona 5, Scramble has its characters fighting waves of enemy Shadows in real-time action, as each character wields their weapons and Persona in battle. The player controls one of up to four different characters, and can switch between them at any time.</p><p>However, like in Persona 5, players will be able to temporarily pause the action to cast spells or perform attacks with their Persona. In Joker's case, he can even swap Personas to match the situation, just as in the original game. All player characters will have separate bars for HP (Health) and SP (Mana), and can level up their stats by earning experience points through battle.</p><p>Also like in Persona 5, Joker can negotiate with enemy Shadows and gain their Persona, and even use Fusion to create a new Persona from two existing Personas.</p><h3>Phantom Move</h3><p>A game mechanic where players can make use of objects like lampposts or traffic lights to pursue or escape from enemies.</p><h3>Showtime</h3><p>An ultimate attack combining the character and their Persona. Joker's Showtime can change depending on the Persona he has equipped when triggering the attack.</p>","expected_release_day":null,"expected_release_month":null,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":null,"guid":"3030-73123","id":73123,"image":{"icon_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/square_avatar/16/165036/3139161-p5s.jpg","medium_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/16/165036/3139161-p5s.jpg","screen_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/screen_medium/16/165036/3139161-p5s.jpg","screen_large_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/screen_kubrick/16/165036/3139161-p5s.jpg","small_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/16/165036/3139161-p5s.jpg","super_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/16/165036/3139161-p5s.jpg","thumb_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_avatar/16/165036/3139161-p5s.jpg","tiny_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/square_mini/16/165036/3139161-p5s.jpg","original_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/16/165036/3139161-p5s.jpg","image_tags":"All

In each round, both players organize the placements of their crew of Heroes in secret (and can swap between them and those on their \"bench\") and then proceed to have them automatically battle (similar to units in real-time strategy games), with the defeated Underlord taking damage based on the winner's surviving units. In addition, players sometimes face waves of CPU-controlled units to earn bonus items that can aid them in fights.</p><p>The game features both online and offline multiplayer, with the former having <a href=\"/cross-platform-multiplayer/3015-4183/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4183\">cross-platform</a> support and ranked matchmaking and the latter having four levels of AI difficulty. It also features a seasonal <a href=\"/battle-pass/3015-9364/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-9364\">Battle Pass</a> system and a new \"Underlord\" system (where players choose a persona with unique gameplay alterations).</p><h2>Heroes</h2><p>Most of the <a href=\"/heroes/3015-315/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-315\">Heroes</a> from <a href=\"/dota-2/3030-32887/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32887\">Dota 2</a> return, all of whom have unique stats (including health, damage, attacking speed, movement speed, attacking range, and resistance to physical and magical damage) and special abilities. During each match, these Heroes can be upgraded twice (once by having two additional Level 1 duplicates and again by having two additional Level 2 duplicates) to improve their stats and abilities.</p><p>Each Hero also has at least two \"Alliance\" Traits to them, granting them special bonuses based on how many unique units of that same Trait is on the playfield.</p><h3>Tier

Awaken. Its development began in February of 2017, and continued on until September of 2018, when the creator ultimately received a Cease and Desist letter from Activision.

dir=\"ltr\">About the game</h4><p dir=\"ltr\">In Alder’s Blood, combat is turn-based, strongly focused on stealth and tactics. Player takes on the role of Chief - a leader of the Hunters’ crew tasked with the unthinkable challenge, to kill their corrupted God. In order to do so, the player has to complete a number of missions, travel around the dying world, craft weapons and tools, and defeat nightmarish creatures. The beasts can easily detect hunters not only with their vision or hearing but also by catching up hunters’ scent. This unique mechanic adjusts diversity to the encounters, forcing the player to also keep in mind the wind direction before conquering any action. Highly influenced by <a href=\"/darkest-dungeon/3030-44203/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-44203\">Darkest Dungeon</a>'s and <a href=\"/bloodborne/3030-46569/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-46569\">Bloodborne</a>’s vibes and aesthetics, Alder’s Blood mixes rough wild west settings with dark, victorian fantasy elements.</p><h4 dir=\"ltr\">Plot:</h4><p dir=\"ltr\">The rotten corpse of God is cursing the lands of Alder’s Blood. The rhythm of day and night has been broken, and the Earth is covered in constant dusk. Balance between people, animals, and plants no longer exists. Humanity is threatened, facing hordes of monsters sent by the avenging nature. The only ones who can prevent the darkness are those who have a tiny bit of the evil force inside them. They are called the Hunters - humanity’s last hope, and player character had been chosen to be their leader - the Chief.</p>","expected_release_day":10,"expected_release_month":4,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":2020,"guid":"3030-75161","id":75161,"image":{"icon_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/square_avatar/43/430704/3127939-newkeayart.png","medium_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/43/430704/3127939-newkeayart.png","screen_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/screen_medium/43/430704/3127939-newkeayart.png","screen_large_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/screen_kubrick/43/430704/3127939-newkeayart.png","small_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/43/430704/3127939-newkeayart.png","super_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/43/430704/3127939-newkeayart.png","thumb_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_avatar/43/430704/3127939-newkeayart.png","tiny_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/square_mini/43/430704/3127939-newkeayart.png","original_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/43/430704/3127939-newkeayart.png","image_tags":"All

Evil forces gather and aim to burn all the world with fire. Player takes the role of Pape and Tura - two inhabitants of said paper world. Pape is a shy humanoid and Tura - a paper kitty cat. Those two are on a quest of saving their paper world, from destruction.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">What makes Papetura stands out, is the fact that the whole game world and every part of it - is made out of actual paper, that the sole developer, Tomasz Ostafin, craft and arranges by hands, manually. Then the scenes and characters, are being scanned, imported into the game engine, and finally - rigged and animated.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The gameplay, puzzles and riddles take great inspiration from the

It uses turn-based vehicle combat in a roguelike adventure style, allowing for deep customization and tactical decisions in a flamboyant and dynamic world. As an RPG, the player will gather loot, transport cargo, take on missions for corporations, drive in convoys, compete in arena duels, and most of all build their fame.</p><p>The world of Auto Fire is not one of dust and misery, it's a place where bored citizens toil away inside walled citadels and live vicariously through reality stars. They must earn their interest by playing for the camera and fighting with flair.

In 'Save The Colony Mode' the objective is to remotely pilot a space blaster and rescue <a href=\"/blastronauts/3015-9467/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-9467\">blastronauts</a> by transporting them to a rescue ship at the bottom of the screen.

'One Shot Mode' and 'To The Death Mode' are 2-player competitive game modes.</p><p>In all modes the player acquires screen-clearing big-bombs, shields, magnets and power-up weapons by destroying enemies. In the 3 none-competitive modes 2-player local co-op play is possible. In the game the player can collect coins called 'credits' by destroying enemies and by completing challenges. These credits can be spent in a shop to upgrade power-ups and weapons, to acquire perks, and to unlock extra music. The credits can also be spent in a mini-shop in the loading screen to acquire extra power-ups such as shields, big-bombs, and protectors. The player will start the game with anything purchased from the mini-shop giving them an advantage against the aliens.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/42/420459/3144632-smsbst%20ss10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3144632\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/42/420459/3144632-smsbst%20ss10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3144632\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/42/420459/3144632-smsbst%20ss10.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/42/420459/3144632-smsbst%20ss10.jpg 1920w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/42/420459/3144632-smsbst%20ss10.jpg 960w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/42/420459/3144632-smsbst%20ss10.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a></figure><h2>Features</h2><ul><li>15 space blasters to unlock.</li><li>5 game modes.</li><li>Loads of strange alien enemies and a challenging boss to battle.</li><li>Local coop &amp; competitive multiplayer.</li><li>Full controller support for all platforms.</li><li>40+ challenges.</li><li>Loads of upgradable power-ups and weapons.</li><li>An in-game shop with perks and upgrades.</li><li>Achievements on Xbox One &amp; Steam and Trophies on PS4.</li><li>Leaderboards.</li><li>An 80's infused synth-pop sound track by <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/electricfandeath\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Electric Fan Death</a>.</li></ul><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/42/420459/3144624-smsbst%20ss02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3144624\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/42/420459/3144624-smsbst%20ss02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3144624\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/42/420459/3144624-smsbst%20ss02.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/42/420459/3144624-smsbst%20ss02.jpg 1920w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/42/420459/3144624-smsbst%20ss02.jpg 960w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/42/420459/3144624-smsbst%20ss02.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/42/420459/3144624-smsbst%20ss02.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/42/420459/3144624-smsbst%20ss02.jpg 1920w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/42/420459/3144624-smsbst%20ss02.jpg 960w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/42/420459/3144624-smsbst%20ss02.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a></figure><h2>Story</h2><p>The game is set in 2051.

The game is set in an East European realm called Vayandor, where an ancient Dark Portal has awakened and is now summoning MONSTERS. Local villagers have to band together and complete a ritual that closes the Portal and cleanses the land of evil.</p><p>One player takes the role of the powerful Monster and gets to play as one of the creatures available in the game. While for now only the Vampire is available, there will be many Monsters from the East European folklore available, such as Baba Yaga, The Strigoi, etc.</p><p>Monsters play something similar to a MOBA character with mana management, abilities and an ultimate. The goal of the Monster is to prevent the ritual from completing or to have all 4 Villagers caught at the same time.</p><p>On the other side, villagers play very differently, having no means of fighting the Monster but only tools of defending and running. And of course, they have each other. The goal of the villagers is to find 5 ritual stones and throw them into the Dark Portal. This sounds easy, but the stones are hidden inside rock Monoliths that need to be destroyed and the Dark Portal is protected by Force Shields that need to be removed before passing through with a ritual stone.</p><p>Villagers can use items they find on the map or that they forge at Altars. These items are not swords and armors but forks, garlic, etc that give villagers special powers.

Set in an alternate reality where literally everything is solved in the boxing ring, even presidential elections, an emerging third-party candidate (controlled by the player) campaigns around the United States of America to battle prominent personalities from the two existing political parties and ascend to the presidency.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Assuming the part of an unnamed candidate, the player controls the action from over the shoulder. Each opponent is a puzzle box that must be unraveled using a limited move set of four punches, two dodges, a block, and a devastating haymaker attack. In doing so, the player must manage a collection of resources. Throwing punches uses stamina, but also fills a power meter. Once the power meter is full, it can be consumed to throw the haymaker.</p><p>Resource management is a game of risk and reward, and differs this game from its source of inspiration. Stamina quickly regenerates while the candidate is idling. Stamina also refills instantly when the haymaker hits its mark. If stamina depletes entirely, the candidate becomes winded and is only able to block. Blocking immediately returns the candidate to the fight and fills the stamina meter, but continued blocking consumes a small amount of power meter each time.</p><p>Both the player and the opponent have a health meter that, when drained, results in a knockdown. If a contestant cannot get back up, or if a contestant suffers three knockdowns in a single round, the match is over and a winner is declared.</p><p>Rounds are short and punctuated by a brief rest. During this time the candidate's coach, Maverick, opines with useful advice for taking down each opponent.</p><p>Advanced players learn how to successfully trade stamina for power before unleashing their most powerful attack when their opponent's guard is down. A well-timed haymaker, and even certain counter attack opportunities, will throw the opponent into a stagger. Staggered opponents can be hit multiple times at little stamina cost before they \"blow out\" beyond the candidate's reach and return to the fight.</p><p>Defensively, dodging an attack costs nothing (though stamina regeneration pauses) and can allow for a follow-up punch to land before the opponent can react. Blocking an attack causes no damage to the candidate, and will also put the player at a massive timing advantage. A perfectly timed block will additionally fill a large portion of the power meter.</p><p>Each opponent has a unique set of skills with which to challenge the candidate. The real challenge of each match is to discover how to overcome the opponent's defenses or exploit a weakness. Some like to brawl, while others are very defensive. All of them have at least one surprise special attack that must be avoided or punished.</p><p>Each opponent also has multiple challenges for the player to complete, ranging from routing them quickly to pulling off flashy, difficult counters and clever strategies. If the player completes all of an opponent's challenges, a harder version of that opponent is unlocked. These \"EX\" or \"Presidential\" fights come with all new gameplay, new moves to overcome, new strategies to discover, and new challenges to complete.</p><h2>Controls</h2><p>Election Year Knockout is designed for touch screens, but can also be played with a controller.</p><p>When using touch controls, tapping any quadrant of the screen throws a punch to that corner. Tapping high throws a jab, and tapping low throws a hook. Holding two thumbs, one on each side of the screen, holds up a block. Swiping up throws a haymaker, and swiping left or right triggers a dodge. Swiping down will also dodge to whichever side of the screen was swiped. The direction of each punch and dodge input can be very important against certain opponents.</p><p>On controller, the left and bottom face buttons throw left and right hooks. The joystick or d-pad can be used to dodge left and right. Pressing down or the right face button holds a block. Holding up modifies the punch buttons to throw jabs. The top face button throws a haymaker. High and low punches may also be controlled by the buttons and triggers, if the controller has them.</p><h2>Game Modes</h2><h3>Campaign</h3><p>Campaign mode is the primary single player game mode of Election Year Knockout. While campaigning, the player travels to different regions of the United States to gain electoral votes, but through boxing. Each region is governed by an entrenches politician from one side of the aisle or another, and winning that region secures it for the player. With each new region won, the player may add another descriptor to the candidate's party name, ultimately creating a long and absurd moniker that a national news host must dutifully announce. Once every region is secured, the player may challenge the White House to become the president.</p><h3>Challenge</h3><p>In Challenge mode, the player may quickly select through any opponent already cleared and review the list of challenges for that opponent. Opponents may still be re-fought from the Campaign map screen.</p>","expected_release_day":null,"expected_release_month":null,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":null,"guid":"3030-76110","id":76110,"image":{"icon_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/square_avatar/44/445029/3145292-eyk_group.png","medium_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/44/445029/3145292-eyk_group.png","screen_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/screen_medium/44/445029/3145292-eyk_group.png","screen_large_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/screen_kubrick/44/445029/3145292-eyk_group.png","small_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/44/445029/3145292-eyk_group.png","super_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/44/445029/3145292-eyk_group.png","thumb_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_avatar/44/445029/3145292-eyk_group.jpg","tiny_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/square_mini/44/445029/3145292-eyk_group.png","original_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/44/445029/3145292-eyk_group.png","image_tags":"All Images"},"image_tags":[{"api_detail_url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-76110/?filter=image_tag%3AAll+Images","name":"All Images","total":1}],"name":"Election Year Knockout","number_of_user_reviews":0,"original_game_rating":null,"original_release_date":"2020-02-14","platforms":[{"api_detail_url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-96/","id":96,"name":"iPhone","site_detail_url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/iphone/3045-96/","abbreviation":"IPHN"},{"api_detail_url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-121/","id":121,"name":"iPad","site_detail_url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/ipad/3045-121/","abbreviation":"IPAD"},{"api_detail_url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-123/","id":123,"name":"Android","site_detail_url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/android/3045-123/","abbreviation":"ANDR"},{"api_detail_url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-155/","id":155,"name":"Amazon Fire TV","site_detail_url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/amazon-fire-tv/3045-155/","abbreviation":"FIRE"}],"site_detail_url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/election-year-knockout/3030-76110/"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-76125/","date_added":"2019-11-23 17:07:58","date_last_updated":"2019-12-10 15:28:29","deck":"A multiplayer sandbox survival game.","description":"<p>Scapevale is a multiplayer sandbox survival game.

It's intended release date is Mid 2020.</p><p> </p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Super Squad contains two game modes: Control and Elimination. Before entering a match, players select whether they want to play 1v1, 2v2, or 3v3, which determines the number of players on each team and whether they control 6, 3, or 2 troopers each. Both game modes involve players entering a head-to-head battle and using a team of six troopers to fight and fulfil relevant win conditions. Players directly control a single trooper and can command the rest of their units to move around the map, freely switching between them at any point during the game.</p><p>In each match, players align themselves with a Faction and build a team of six troopers out of a roster. Each trooper possesses unique stats and abilities that influence how the player uses them and aims to win a match.</p><h3> </h3><h3>Game Mode: Control</h3><p>In the Control game mode, players control a team of six troopers which they must use to capture and hold down Control Points around the map. Each Squad starts with 200 Victory Points and loses points over time for each Control Point the enemy holds. The first player to reduce the enemy's Victory Points to zero wins the match.</p><p> </p><h3>Game Mode: Elimination</h3><p>In the Elimination game mode, players control a team of six troopers which they must use to kill the enemy team. There are no respawns, so the first player to wipe out their opponent's Squad wins the round. Players compete to see who wins the best out of 5 rounds.</p><p> </p><h2>Factions, Maps, and Troopers</h2><table data-max-width=\"true\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Faction</th><th scope=\"col\">Maps</th><th scope=\"col\">Availability</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Military</td><td>Abandoned Town, Military Base, Urban Battleground, Military Arena</td><td>Base Game</td></tr><tr><td>Alien</td><td>Martian Town, Asteroid Colony, Mothership, Alien Arena</td><td>Base Game</td></tr><tr><td>Pirate</td><td>Dock Town, Under the Sea, Underbelly, Pirate Arena</td><td>Super Pack DLC</td></tr><tr><td>Fantasy</td><td>Medieval Town, Goblin Mine, Frosty Hallows, Fantasy Arena</td><td>Super Pack DLC</td></tr></tbody></table><h3> </h3><h3>Factions:</h3><p>Each time a player enters a match, they select a <a href=\"/rivaling-factions/3015-3656/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3656\">Faction</a> to play as. The difference between Factions is purely aesthetic, with no statistical or other changes that influence gameplay.</p><p> </p><h3>Maps:</h3><p>Each time a player enters a match, they select a Map to play on. Each Faction has three unique Maps that reflect their theme for the Control game mode, and an additional Arena Map for Elimination.</p><p> </p><h3>Troopers:</h3><p>Each time a player enters a match, they build a team of six troopers from the roster of sixteen. Troopers have different stats, abilities, and roles that - when balanced across a Squad - form a team composition.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Soldier: </strong>The Soldier is a powerful and short ranged trooper that shines during Close Quarters Combat. They can use Cluster Grenade to burst down the enemy team and Suppressive Fire to run into the heat of battle.</p><p><strong>Heavy: </strong>The Heavy fares best on the front lines, absorbing damage and taking the brunt of any assault. They can use Reserves to boost their survivability during combat, and Charge to push enemies off objectives and hold them.</p><p><strong>Ranger: </strong>The Ranger excels in taking out high priority targets, dishing out damage from across the map. Their Knockback Shot causes massive damage and stuns enemies, and their Hookshot lets them quickly reposition.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>The Leader makes an ideal support trooper, ready to lead your squad into combat with powerful buffs. Their Battle Flag creates defensible positions which buff nearby Troopers, and Focus increases one trooper’s damage.</p><p><strong>Medic: </strong>The Medic is a dedicated Healer that can keep your troopers alive and fighting on the battlefield. Their ‘Splosion can heal groups of allies or harm enemies, and Transfusion gifts temporary lifesteal to the target trooper.</p><p><strong>Mechanist: </strong>The Mechanist dominates the battlefield by locking down areas and sending out huge area damage. Their Deploy Turret ability keeps enemies at bay, whilst Rain of Fire doles out damage that will make enemies burn.</p><p><strong>Sapper: </strong>The Sapper alters the battlefield to their advantage through powerful Area Control and movement. They can block off routes with Minor Inconvenience, and help their team subvert enemy blockades with Burrow.</p><p><strong>Hunter: </strong>The Hunter is no slouch when it comes to dealing large amounts of damage at close quarters. They can cause disarray and debuff enemies with Smoke Bomb, or use Fetch to drag enemies into vulnerable positions.</p><p><strong>Spy: </strong>The Spy is an extremely dynamic trooper, able to heal, stun, and cause devastating damage. Their Mysterious Liquid allows them to stun enemies or heal allies, whilst Double O’s unleashes a destructive path of pain.</p><p><strong>Tactician: </strong>The Tactician is at home on the front lines, protecting your less resilient troopers from damage. Their Overcharge ability soaks up enemy fire and throws it back, whereas Rallying Call buffs allies.</p><p><strong>Assassin: </strong>The Assassin is specialised in single target damage and mobility, jumping in and out of the fray. Their Back Stab ability singles out high priority targets to eliminate, and Poison Grenade can clear enemies out of an area.</p><p><strong>Scientist: </strong>The Scientist is a lifeline on the battlefield, maintaining your troopers health from the back line. Their Healing Pulse Turret keeps nearby troopers topped up on health, and Syringe Shot heals allies or harms enemies.</p><p><strong>Electrician: </strong>The Electrician possesses shockingly powerful Area Control abilities that will leave enemies reeling. They can use Electric Turret to create damaging zones, or Electric Grenade to stun and damage groups of enemies.</p><p><strong>Supplier: </strong>The Supplier plays a dual role, both disrupting groups of enemies and helping Troopers stay alive. Their Body Bomb wreaks havoc on clumped up enemies, whilst their Med Kit creates stations where Troopers can heal up.</p><p><strong>Trapper: </strong>The Trapper is true to their name, laying traps to create near impenetrable barriers around the map. Their Poison Mine infects enemies with a contagious poison cloud, while their Caltrops slow and damage enemies.</p><p><strong>Recon: </strong>The Recon is a long-range specialist, perfect for boosting team damage and decimating far off targets. Their Mark singles out an enemy to take 2x damage from friendly troopers, and Annihilate calls down a devastating air strike.</p>","expected_release_day":null,"expected_release_month":4,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":2020,"guid":"3030-76162","id":76162,"image":{"icon_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87610/3162913-giantbomb-keyart.png","medium_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87610/3162913-giantbomb-keyart.png","screen_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87610/3162913-giantbomb-keyart.png","screen_large_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/87610/3162913-giantbomb-keyart.png","small_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87610/3162913-giantbomb-keyart.png","super_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87610/3162913-giantbomb-keyart.png","thumb_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87610/3162913-giantbomb-keyart.png","tiny_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87610/3162913-giantbomb-keyart.png","original_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/87610/3162913-giantbomb-keyart.png","image_tags":"All Images"},"image_tags":[{"api_detail_url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-76162/?filter=image_tag%3AAll+Images","name":"All Images","total":12}],"name":"Super Squad","number_of_user_reviews":0,"original_game_rating":null,"original_release_date":null,"platforms":[{"api_detail_url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/","id":94,"name":"PC","site_detail_url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/","abbreviation":"PC"}],"site_detail_url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/super-squad/3030-76162/"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-76180/","date_added":"2019-11-28 15:30:15","date_last_updated":"2020-03-03 11:02:29","deck":"The 2020 version of Risk on Steam.","description":"<h2>Overview</h2><p>Risk: Global Domination is a virtual board game developed and published by SMG Studio for PC, iPhone, iPad, and Android.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p> </p><p>Risk: Global Domination is a digital version of the classic board game.

Cthulhu Mythos created by H.P. Lovecraft. The game features a unique Infinite Dungeon adventure system, filled with NPCs pulled from Lovecraft's lore. Players can crawl through these dungeons solo, with a small group of friends, or with a guild. The Yellow King has an open Overworld which contains many smaller dungeons and places to adventure, including player vs. player arenas.</p><p>The Yellow King is available as an Early Access title from Steam. The game opened on February 5th, 2020.</p><h2><ins>Gameplay</ins></h2><h4>The Game World</h4><p>Players move around the Overworld and can discover entrances to smaller non-instanced Overworld dungeons, including caves, castles, and buildings. The Overworld is shared content, and is not instanced between players or groups. Open PvP is allowed in some Overworld areas, but it is entirely optional.</p><p>The major focus of the game is the instanced Infinite Dungeon system, where players can explore a seeded procedurally-generated dungeon. Each day the Infinite Dungeon is reset, and a new dungeon replaces it. A detailed leader board tracks each player and guild's progress through the Infinite Dungeons. Dungeon rooms may contain Lovecraftian-themed NPCs, breakable objects, hidden rooms, puzzles, mazes, and boss encounters.</p><h4>Combat &amp; Weapons</h4><p>The Yellow King features a hack-and-slash gameplay style, with a wide variety of weapon archetypes to choose from. These archetypes include one-handed weapons and shields, dual wielded weapons, and two-handed weapons. Weapons can either be melee, ranged, or hybrid styles. All weapons have special \"power\" attacks which require a short \"charge up\" period to use.</p><p>Weapon types:</p><ul><li>One-handed swords (broken, short, long)</li><li>Two-handed swords (greatsword, bastard sword)</li><li>Blunt weapons (club, heavy club)</li><li>Hammers (hammer, heavy hammer)</li><li>Spear-types (light spear, heavy spear)</li><li>Ranged weapons (various bows and crossbows)</li><li>Shields</li></ul><p>Combat and defense is physics-based. If an attack hits a shield, damage is automatically blocked. Players can also perform dodge rolls and well-timed jumps to avoid enemy attacks.</p><p>There are no \"character classes\" in The Yellow King. A player's gameplay experience and abilities is tailored to his liking by which two weapon sets he or she chooses to use at any given time.</p><h4>Skills</h4><p>Weapons require specific skills to use. Each weapon is classified under certain types, and those skills must be trained to equip the weapon. For instance, a longsword requires the skills \"one-handed weapon\" and \"slashing weapons\" to use. Skills are upgraded by using Runestones, a common currency found as treasure in the game world.</p><h4>Character Customization and Cosmetic Items</h4><p>Players are given a wide number of options to use to customize the appearance of their character. Armor and clothing are entirely cosmetic, and can be purchased in the game's cosmetic store using Gold, a currency found while adventuring in the game. Cosmetic items are also found as loot drops from bosses, and given as rewards for completing challenges and achievements.</p><p> </p><h4>

It is the first chapter of the full game. Nocturne: Prelude was developed in Unity.</p><p>The story takes place in a digital afterlife where the protagonist (known by default as Karma) has woken up after dying in the real world. Discovering that thousands of years have passed since their death and the afterlife is now in ruins, they begin the search for their brother with the help of Kimothy (a child who is obsessed with ninjas and doesn't know when to stop talking) and Satoru (a human-koi fish monk who is wise and knowledgeable about the world).</p><h3>Gameplay</h3><p>Players explore the 2D pixel art world called Maya from a top-down perspective. They speak with non-player characters through written dialogue and collect items they find around the world. During exploration, combat is initiated as a random encounter which transitions the player to a separate combat screen.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/45/457957/3169599-nocturne%2Bcombat%2Broach.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3169599\" data-ratio=\"0.563\" data-width=\"1000\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/45/457957/3169599-nocturne%2Bcombat%2Broach.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3169599\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/45/457957/3169599-nocturne%2Bcombat%2Broach.png\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/45/457957/3169599-nocturne%2Bcombat%2Broach.png 1000w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/45/457957/3169599-nocturne%2Bcombat%2Broach.png 960w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/45/457957/3169599-nocturne%2Bcombat%2Broach.png 480w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/45/457957/3169599-nocturne%2Bcombat%2Broach.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>The game features a Rhythm based combat system, which is similar to many traditional Rhythm games, though with the addition of RPG-like abilities. The player can obtain passive or active combat abilities through equipment found in the world or as rewards for defeating creatures.</p><p>The player must defeat the enemy by correctly playing notes which fall down 4 separate columns, each assigned to a different key. For each note the player misses, the enemy's next attack will be more powerful. They must reach the end of the battle without losing all their health to win the encounter.</p><p>In addition to the Rhythm based combat, there is also a non-combat Rhythm mechanic where the player must correctly play a short musical tune with high enough accuracy to progress through the story. During this event, the music columns can move around the screen or become invisible.</p><h4>Note Types</h4><p>Nocturne: Prelude's rhythm combat features multiple note types which have different effects during the battle.</p><ul><li><strong>Standard</strong>: Missing these notes will cause the enemy's next attack to do increased damage</li><li><strong>Mines</strong>: Hitting these notes will disable the corresponding column, preventing player input for 2 seconds.</li><li><strong>Critical</strong>: These electrified notes will cause the enemy's next attack to increase in damage by twice the amount of a standard note.</li></ul><h4><strong>Abilities &amp; Effects</strong></h4><p>Players can equip items which provide either Passive Effects or Active Abilities, in addition to increased base stats of health and armor.</p><ul><li><strong>Restore</strong>: Heals the player for every 15 perfect notes they hit.</li><li><strong>Barrier</strong>: Creates a barrier which protects the player from additional damage for every 15 notes in a row they hit (combo).</li><li><strong>Failsafe</strong>: Protects the player from a fatal attack.</li><li><strong>Coolant</strong>: Provides immunity to the effects of the Mines.</li><li><strong>Fortify</strong> (Active): Temporarily increases the player's armor for the next attack.</li></ul><h3>Beta Release</h3><p>A public beta was released on January 19th 2019 that allowed players to play through the first half of Nocturne: Prelude.
